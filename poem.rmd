A war forced our cousins     
to buy false passports, lose their savings.     
  
We ate Chef Boyardee after school,     
hot spinach and meatball soup     
on the weekends. I yelled into a phone     
  
so my Iranian family could hear     
me. I learned I was the silk carpet     
my mother didn’t own, the casino     
  
payout my father kept chasing.     
I didn’t know until later     
the Persian Leopard was trapped     
  
in the Zagros mountains after     
the Iran-Iraq war, in danger     
of tripping old mines.
